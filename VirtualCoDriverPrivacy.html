<p>

    anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
    as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at

<p>
    We want to inform you that during our app use
    you will be asked to provide several permissions listed below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>RECORD AUDIO – app's aim is to create voice recordings;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>
    We value your trust in providing us your
    Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
    acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
    of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
    storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot
    guarantee its absolute security.
